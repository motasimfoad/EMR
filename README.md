##EMR

“EMR” is a platform collaborating with mainstream latest web technologies and API’s to help Doctors/ Patient/ Hospitals/ Pharmacies to better serve through this procedure. We used HTML, CSS, JSx, Bootstraps, MDL, ReactJS for front end. To create the backend api we used GraphQl by the framework Graph.Cool.  Which turns our backend engine to BAAS. We used Apollo Client to fetch that data. So, this is a one stop point for patient, doctor, dispensaries and diagnostic center.
